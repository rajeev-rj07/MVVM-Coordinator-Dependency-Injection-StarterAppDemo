# MVVM-Coordinator-Dependency-Injection-StarterAppDemo

This project follows the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) pattern, along with Dependency Injection (DI) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
It's a skeleton app designed to be a kickstarter for any new project. Simply follow the comments and sample code provided, and you'll be able to understand its structure and make the necessary modifications.

This skeleton app gives you an idea on how I personally setup my projects if I were to make them from scratch.
API service integration using Moya with Combine.
Testing setup with Dependency Injection using the Swinject library.

# Unit tests will be added soon
